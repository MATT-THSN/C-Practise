    -   Create a phonebook program that enables users to enter names and phone numbers of
        friends and acquintances. Create a structure to hold contact information, and use
        calloc() to reserve the first memory segment. The user should be able to add or modify
        phone book entries through a menu. Use the realloc() function to add contiguous memory
        segments to the original memory block when a user adds a new book entry.
