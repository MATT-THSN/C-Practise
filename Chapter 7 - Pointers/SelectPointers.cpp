    - Create a program that allows the user to select one of the following four menu options:
        * Enter a new integer value
        * Prints the value of each pointer variable
        * Prints the address of each nonpointer variable
        * Prints the address of each pointer variable
    - For this program, you need to create two variables: one integer data type and one pointer. 
    Using indirection, assign any new integer value that the user enters through an appropriate pointer.
